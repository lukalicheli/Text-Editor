## Usage
All you have to do is npm install. Everything required should download automatically and a server connection should be established. Once you open the text editor, you can start typing away notes and if you click off the page, the information will persist. You can also download the app to be able to use it offline as a native app. 

## Contributing
So far I am the sole contributor to this project.
